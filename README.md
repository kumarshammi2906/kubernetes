Introduction on Kubernetes
Author - Shammi Kumar

What is Kubernetes (k8s)?
Kubernetes is an open-source Container Management tool that automates container deployment, container scaling, descaling, and container load balancing (also called a container orchestration tool). 
It is written in Golang and has a vast community because it was first developed by Google and later donated to CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation). 
Kubernetes can group ‘n’ number of containers into one logical unit for managing and deploying them easily. 
It works brilliantly with all cloud vendors i.e. public, hybrid, and on-premises. 


Benefits of Using Kubernetes
1. Automated deployment and management
2. Scalability
3. High availability
